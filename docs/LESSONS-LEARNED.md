# Lessons Learned

Key insights for future AI agents working on this codebase.

## Architecture Decisions

### LyricsTranscriber: Library, Not Server

**Problem**: LyricsTranscriber's `ReviewServer` blocks waiting for human input - incompatible with async cloud architecture.

**Solution**: Use LyricsTranscriber as a library:
- Call `transcribe()` and `correct()` for processing
- Save `corrections.json` to GCS
- Skip `ReviewServer` entirely
- Call `OutputGenerator` only after human review completes

**What to use**: `LyricsTranscriber`, `CorrectionResult`, `OutputGenerator`, `OutputConfig`, `CorrectionOperations`

**What NOT to use**: `ReviewServer`, `server.start()`, blocking waits

### Video Generation Timing

**Wrong**: Generate video during lyrics worker, then review
**Right**: Lyrics worker saves JSON → Human reviews → Render worker generates video

Video must include human-corrected lyrics, so generation happens AFTER review.

### Parallel Processing

Audio separation and lyrics transcription run in parallel:
- Both can fail independently
- Progress tracked separately in `state_data`
- Screens generation waits for both to complete

## Common Gotchas

### Pydantic Model Fields

**Problem**: Setting a field that doesn't exist in the Pydantic model silently does nothing.

```python
# BAD - fails silently if field doesn't exist
job.input_media_gcs_path = "path/to/file"

# GOOD - explicit field in model
class Job(BaseModel):
    input_media_gcs_path: Optional[str] = None
```

**Lesson**: Always verify Pydantic model has the field before setting it.

### Styles Configuration

ASS subtitle generator requires ALL style fields present and properly typed:

```python
required_fields = [
    "font", "font_path", "ass_name",  # ass_name often missed
    "primary_color", "secondary_color", "outline_color", "back_color",
    "bold", "italic", "underline", "strike_out",
    "scale_x", "scale_y", "spacing", "angle",
    "border_style", "outline", "shadow",
    "margin_l", "margin_r", "margin_v", "encoding"
]

# Critical: font_path must be string, not None
"font_path": ""  # Correct
"font_path": None  # Causes ASS writer to fail
```

### Frontend Data Format

The React review UI sends partial correction data:

```python
# Frontend sends:
{"corrections": [...], "corrected_segments": [...]}

# Backend must merge with original corrections.json
```

### Firestore Consistency

**Problem**: Update job, trigger worker immediately, worker reads stale data.

**Solution**: Verify updates propagated before triggering workers:
```python
# Update job
await job_manager.update_job(job_id, updates)

# Verify update visible
job = await job_manager.get_job(job_id)
if job.input_media_gcs_path:
    await trigger_worker()
```

## Testing Insights

### Emulator Tests Catch Real Bugs

Unit tests with mocks didn't catch the `input_media_gcs_path` bug. Emulator integration tests did because they use real Firestore behavior.

**Lesson**: Run `make test` which includes emulator tests before every commit.

### Test Isolation

Emulator tests need their own `conftest.py` that does NOT mock `google.cloud.*`. Mocks from unit tests can leak into integration tests.

## Deployment Notes

### Cloud Run Timeouts

Default 5-minute timeout may not be enough for video encoding. Consider:
- Cloud Run Jobs for long-running tasks
- Breaking encoding into smaller chunks
- Increasing timeout for specific operations

### Secret Manager Access

Cloud Run service account needs `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` role. This is managed via Pulumi in `infrastructure/`.

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Migrated from Cloud Build to GitHub Actions for:
- Simpler configuration
- Better visibility
- Faster feedback

## Performance Observations

| Operation | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| Audio separation | 5-8 min |
| Lyrics transcription | 2-3 min |
| Auto-correction | 30 sec |
| Screens generation | 30 sec |
| Video rendering | 10-15 min |
| Final encoding | 5-10 min |
| **Total** | 30-50 min |

Human review time varies (5-15 min typical).

### Gitignore Patterns for Monorepos

**Problem**: Root `.gitignore` had `lib/` to ignore Python lib directories, but this also ignored `buy-site/lib/` (frontend code).

**Solution**: Use negation patterns for frontend directories:
```gitignore
# Python lib directories
lib/
lib64/
# But allow frontend lib directories
!frontend/lib/
!buy-site/lib/
```

**Lesson**: When adding gitignore patterns, consider their effect on subdirectories, especially in monorepos with multiple languages.

### Firestore Transactions for Race Conditions

**Problem**: Magic link verification had a race condition - concurrent requests could both verify the same token before it was marked as used.

**Solution**: Use Firestore transactions for atomic read-check-update operations:
```python
@firestore.transactional
def verify_in_transaction(transaction):
    doc = doc_ref.get(transaction=transaction)
    # Check conditions...
    transaction.update(doc_ref, {'used': True})
```

## What We'd Do Differently

1. **Add Pydantic model fields test first** - Would have caught the silent field issue immediately

2. **Use emulator tests from day one** - Faster feedback than deploying to test

3. **Design for async human review upfront** - Avoided rearchitecting after discovering ReviewServer blocks

4. **Keep docs minimal and current** - Less documentation, but always accurate

5. **Check gitignore early for new directories** - Especially when adding frontend `lib/` directories
