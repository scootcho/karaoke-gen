### Positional Arguments

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| P1 | `<file>` | ✅ | ✅ | **Local audio file path.** Copies file to output directory, converts to WAV for processing. Supports MP3, FLAC, WAV, M4A, OGG, AAC. |
| P2 | `<url>` (YouTube) | ✅ | ✅ | **YouTube/online URL.** Uses yt-dlp to download audio and extract metadata (artist/title from video title). |
| P3 | `<artist> <title>` | ✅ | ✅ | **Audio search mode.** When no file is provided, uses flacfetch to search Deezer/Tidal/etc for high-quality audio and downloads it. |
| P4 | `<folder>` | ✅ | ❌ | **Batch folder processing.** Process all audio files in a folder, using `--filename_pattern` to extract track titles from filenames. |

**Remote Implementation Status:** ✅ **BATCH 4 & 5 COMPLETE** (v0.71.42)
- **P2 YouTube URLs**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Backend accepts URL via `/api/jobs/create-from-url` endpoint. Uses yt-dlp to download audio and extract metadata (artist/title). Remote CLI detects URLs and routes to URL endpoint.
- **P3 Flacfetch search**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Remote CLI submits artist+title, backend searches via flacfetch. Returns results for interactive selection (or auto-selects with `-y`/`--auto-download`). New job statuses: `searching_audio`, `awaiting_audio_selection`, `downloading_audio`.
- **P4 Folder batch**: LOW PRIORITY. Could accept ZIP upload, process each as separate job. Defer for now.

### Workflow Control

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| W1 | `--prep-only` | ✅ | ❌ | **Stop after preparation phase.** Downloads audio, separates stems, transcribes lyrics, creates title/end screens, but does NOT run finalisation (encoding, YouTube upload, etc.). Useful for reviewing intermediate outputs before committing to final render. |
| W2 | `--finalise-only` | ✅ | ❌ | **Run only finalisation phase.** Must be run from a directory that was previously prepared with `--prep-only`. Picks up where prep left off: encodes videos, creates CDG/TXT packages, uploads to YouTube/Dropbox, etc. |
| W3 | `--skip-transcription` | ✅ | ❌ | **Skip automatic lyrics transcription.** Skips the AudioShake transcription and auto-correction steps. Use this if you want to manually provide lyrics or if transcription keeps failing. Lyrics review UI will still open if you have existing lyrics files. |
| W4 | `--skip-separation` | ✅ | ❌ | **Skip audio separation.** Skips the AI-powered stem separation (Modal API). Useful when re-processing a track where you already have the stems from a previous run, or when combined with `--existing_instrumental`. |
| W5 | `--skip-lyrics` | ✅ | ❌ | **Skip all lyrics processing.** Skips fetching lyrics from Genius/Spotify, transcription, and review. Output will have no lyrics overlay - just instrumental video with title/end screens. |
| W6 | `--lyrics-only` | ✅ | ❌ | **Process only lyrics.** Sets `--skip-separation` and skips title/end screen generation. Useful for re-doing just the lyrics on an existing track without re-running expensive audio separation. |
| W7 | `--edit-lyrics` | ✅ | ❌ | **Edit lyrics of existing track.** Run from inside an existing track directory (e.g., `NOMAD-1234 - Artist - Title/`). Backs up existing outputs, re-runs lyrics transcription with the existing audio, then re-renders and re-uploads. Uses `--keep-brand-code` implicitly. |
| W8 | `--resume` | N/A | 🔹 | **Resume monitoring a job.** Reconnects to an existing remote job and continues monitoring its progress, handling review/instrumental selection if needed. |
| W9 | `--cancel` | N/A | 🔹 | **Cancel a running job.** Stops processing but keeps the job record in Firestore. Useful for aborting stuck jobs. |
| W10 | `--retry` | N/A | 🔹 | **Retry a failed job.** Restarts processing from the last successful checkpoint. Only works on jobs with `failed` status. |
| W11 | `--delete` | N/A | 🔹 | **Delete a job.** Permanently removes job record from Firestore and all associated files from GCS. |
| W12 | `--list` | N/A | 🔹 | **List all jobs.** Shows all jobs with their status, artist, title. Supports filtering with `--filter-environment` and `--filter-client-id`. |

**Remote Implementation Plan:**
- **W1 `--prep-only`**: HIGH PRIORITY. Remote CLI submits job with `prep_only=true`. Backend runs all prep tasks (audio separation, lyrics transcription with review UI, initial render). After completion, CLI downloads the entire output folder and exits. No finalisation (encoding, YouTube, Dropbox, etc.) runs. Use case: Client needs custom edits to stems or lyrics before final render.
- **W2 `--finalise-only`**: HIGH PRIORITY. Remote CLI checks current directory for expected prep output files. Uploads ALL files from that folder to backend (including any manual customizations user made since prep). Backend runs finalisation and distribution steps. Use case: User edited instrumental manually, now wants cloud to handle encoding/distribution.
- **W3-W6 Skip flags**: LOW PRIORITY. Rarely used; typically all together to regenerate title/end screens with different artist/title. Defer until pipeline refactor provides cleaner stage-targeting.
- **W7 `--edit-lyrics`**: MEDIUM PRIORITY. Re-runs lyrics worker with existing audio/stems. Creates NEW YouTube upload (doesn't delete/replace existing). Backend should handle gracefully if video with identical title already exists (user will have manually deleted old one). Use case: Customer found typo in published video.

### Logging & Debugging

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| D1 | `--log_level` | ✅ | ✅ | **Set logging verbosity.** Options: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`. Default: `info`. Affects console output detail level. |
| D2 | `--dry_run` | ✅ | ❌ | **Simulate without changes.** Runs through the workflow logic but doesn't actually download, process, or create files. Useful for testing argument combinations. |
| D3 | `--render_bounding_boxes` | ✅ | ❌ | **Debug text positioning.** Renders red bounding boxes around text regions in title/end screen images. Helps debug custom style configurations. |

**Remote Implementation Plan:**
- **D2 `--dry_run`**: LOW PRIORITY. Backend could accept `dry_run=true`, validate inputs and return what WOULD happen without processing. Nice to have for testing.
- **D3 `--render_bounding_boxes`**: LOW PRIORITY. Backend could enable this, useful for testing styles before full render. Nice to have for debugging style configs.

---

### Input/Output Configuration

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| I1 | `--filename_pattern` | ✅ | N/A | **Regex for batch processing.** Python regex with named group `(?P<title>...)` to extract track title from filenames. Used with folder input. Example: `'(?P<index>\d+) - (?P<title>.+).mp3'` |
| I2 | `--output_dir` | ✅ | ✅ | **Output directory.** Where to write output files. Local: creates subdirectory per track. Remote: where to download completed files. Default: current directory. |
| I3 | `--no_track_subfolders` | 🗑️ | N/A | **REMOVE FROM LOCAL CLI.** Flat output structure. Not needed - always create subfolders. |
| I4 | `--lossless_output_format` | 🗑️ | N/A | **REMOVE FROM LOCAL CLI.** Stem audio format. FLAC is always fine, no need for WAV option. |
| I5 | `--output_png` | 🗑️ | N/A | **REMOVE FROM LOCAL CLI.** Always output both PNG and JPG, no need for flag. |
| I6 | `--output_jpg` | 🗑️ | N/A | **REMOVE FROM LOCAL CLI.** Always output both PNG and JPG, no need for flag. |

**Remote Implementation Plan:**
- **I3, I4, I5, I6**: REMOVE from local CLI entirely. Not worth maintaining. Backend always uses FLAC, outputs both PNG+JPG, creates subfolders.

---

### Audio Fetching Configuration

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| A1 | `--auto-download` | ✅ | ✅ | **Auto-select audio source.** When using artist+title search mode (flacfetch), automatically select the best quality source instead of prompting for manual selection. Useful for scripted/batch processing. |

**Remote Implementation Status:** ✅ **BATCH 5 COMPLETE** (v0.71.28)
- **A1 `--auto-download`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Backend supports BOTH modes:
  - **Interactive (default)**: API returns search results to client. Client displays options, user selects via `/api/audio-search/{job_id}/select` endpoint.
  - **Auto-download (`--auto-download` or `-y`)**: Backend auto-selects best quality source using flacfetch's ranking.

---

### Audio Processing Configuration

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| AP1 | `--clean_instrumental_model` | ✅ | ✅ | **Stage 1 separation model.** AI model for initial vocal/instrumental separation. Default: `model_bs_roformer_ep_317_sdr_12.9755.ckpt`. Different models have different quality/speed tradeoffs. |
| AP2 | `--backing_vocals_models` | ✅ | ✅ | **Stage 2 separation model(s).** AI model(s) for separating lead vocals from backing vocals. Default: `mel_band_roformer_karaoke_aufr33_viperx_sdr_10.1956.ckpt`. |
| AP3 | `--other_stems_models` | ✅ | ✅ | **Multi-stem separation model.** AI model for separating drums, bass, guitar, piano, other. Default: `htdemucs_6s.yaml`. |
| AP4 | `--model_file_dir` | ✅ | N/A | **Model cache directory.** Where to store/load AI model files. Default: `/tmp/audio-separator-models/`. |
| AP5 | `--existing_instrumental` | ✅ | ✅ | **Use pre-made instrumental.** Path to an existing instrumental file to use instead of running AI separation. Useful when you have a better instrumental from another source (official instrumental release, manual editing, etc.). Backend still runs separation for stems, but uses provided instrumental for final video. |
| AP6 | `--instrumental_format` | 🗑️ | N/A | **REMOVE FROM LOCAL CLI.** FLAC is always fine, no need for format option. |

**Remote Implementation Status:** ✅ **BATCH 2 & 3 COMPLETE** (PR #9 v0.71.24, PR #10 v0.71.26)
- **AP1 `--clean_instrumental_model`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Sent as form field to backend. Audio worker passes to Modal API.
- **AP2 `--backing_vocals_models`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Sent as comma-separated list, parsed and passed to Modal API.
- **AP3 `--other_stems_models`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Sent as comma-separated list, parsed and passed to Modal API.
- **AP4 `--model_file_dir`**: N/A for remote - Modal API handles model caching internally.
- **AP5 `--existing_instrumental`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Batch 3). User uploads instrumental file with job. Backend validates duration match (±0.5s), still runs separation for stems, but uses provided instrumental for final video encoding.
- **AP6**: REMOVE from local CLI - FLAC is always fine.

### Lyrics Configuration

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| L1 | `--lyrics_artist` | ✅ | ✅ | **Override artist for lyrics search.** Use different artist name when searching Genius/Spotify/Musixmatch for lyrics. Useful for covers, remixes, or when artist name differs in lyrics databases. Example: `--lyrics_artist="The Beatles"` when your file says "Beatles, The". |
| L2 | `--lyrics_title` | ✅ | ✅ | **Override title for lyrics search.** Use different song title when searching for lyrics. Useful for songs with alternate titles, subtitle variations, or "(Remastered)" suffixes. Example: `--lyrics_title="Hey Jude"` when file says "Hey Jude - 2009 Remaster". |
| L3 | `--lyrics_file` | ✅ | ✅ | **Use existing lyrics file.** Path to a text file containing lyrics to use instead of fetching from online sources. Supports TXT, DOCX, RTF formats. Useful when online lyrics are wrong or unavailable. Transcription still runs to generate timestamps. |
| L4 | `--subtitle_offset_ms` | ✅ | ✅ | **Adjust subtitle timing.** Shift all subtitle timestamps by N milliseconds. Positive values delay subtitles, negative values advance them. Useful when audio has intro padding or sync drift. Example: `--subtitle_offset_ms=500` delays by 0.5 seconds. |
| L5 | `--skip_transcription_review` | ✅ | ⚠️ | **Skip review UI.** Don't open the browser-based lyrics review interface after transcription. Use existing auto-corrected lyrics as-is. Remote: use `-y` flag instead for non-interactive mode. |

**Remote Implementation Status:** ✅ **BATCH 1 COMPLETE** (PR #8, v0.71.22)
- **L1 `--lyrics_artist`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Sent as form field to backend. Lyrics worker uses for Genius/Spotify/AudioShake queries.
- **L2 `--lyrics_title`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Sent as form field to backend. Lyrics worker uses for search instead of main title.
- **L3 `--lyrics_file`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Uploaded with job, stored in GCS. Lyrics worker reads it instead of fetching online.
- **L4 `--subtitle_offset_ms`**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED. Sent to backend, render worker applies offset when burning subtitles.
- **L5 `--skip_transcription_review`**: Already works via `-y` flag which auto-accepts corrections.

### Style Configuration

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| S1 | `--style_params_json` | ✅ | ✅ | **Style configuration file.** Path to JSON file defining visual style: background images, fonts, colors, text positioning for intro/karaoke/end screens and CDG. All referenced image/font files are auto-uploaded in remote mode. |
| S2 | `--style_override` | ✅ | ❌ | **Quick style tweaks.** Override specific style parameters without editing JSON. Can be used multiple times. Format: `section.key=value`. Example: `--style_override 'intro.background_image=/path/to/new_bg.png'`. Creates a temp JSON file with overrides merged. |
| S3 | `--background_video` | ✅ | ❌ | **Video background for karaoke.** Path to video file to use as animated background instead of static image for the karaoke section. Video is looped/trimmed to match audio duration, with lyrics overlaid. |
| S4 | `--background_video_darkness` | ✅ | ❌ | **Dim video background.** Darkness overlay percentage (0-100) applied to video background so lyrics are more readable. 0 = no darkening, 100 = completely black. Default: 0. |

**Remote Implementation Plan:**
- **S2 `--style_override`**: MEDIUM PRIORITY. Send override strings to backend, merge server-side before passing to workers. Works same as local (creates merged config). Use case: Web UI will let users tweak font colors etc., needs to pass adjustments to backend.
- **S3 `--background_video`**: MEDIUM PRIORITY. Upload video file with job. Backend processes with VideoBackgroundProcessor (loop/trim to audio duration). Requires larger file upload limits. Future: Web UI could allow YouTube URL or direct upload for video background.
- **S4 `--background_video_darkness`**: Depends on S3. Send percentage to backend, apply overlay during video processing.

### Finalisation Configuration

| # | Parameter | Local | Remote | Description |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| F1 | `--enable_cdg` | ✅ | ✅ | **Generate CDG+MP3 package.** Create CD+Graphics karaoke format files (used by karaoke machines). Produces ZIP containing `.cdg` and `.mp3` files. Requires `cdg` section in style_params_json. |
| F2 | `--enable_txt` | ✅ | ✅ | **Generate TXT+MP3 package.** Create text-based karaoke format with timed lyrics. Produces ZIP containing `.txt` (with timestamps) and `.mp3` files. |
| F3 | `--brand_prefix` | ✅ | ✅ | **Brand code prefix.** Your brand identifier for sequential numbering. When set, output folder is renamed to `PREFIX-XXXX - Artist - Title` where XXXX is the next sequential number found in `organised_dir` or Dropbox. Example: `NOMAD` produces `NOMAD-1234`. |
| F4 | `--organised_dir` | ✅ | N/A | **Local organized output.** Local filesystem path where final track folders are moved after processing. Used with `--brand_prefix` to maintain organized library. Example: `/Volumes/Media/Karaoke/Tracks-Organized/`. |
| F5 | `--organised_dir_rclone_root` | ✅ | ✅ | **Rclone path for Dropbox.** Rclone remote path that maps to your organised_dir. Used to calculate next brand code number and for rclone-based uploads. Example: `dropbox:Media/Karaoke/Tracks-Organized`. |
| F6 | `--public_share_dir` | ✅ | N/A | **Local public share folder.** Local filesystem path where shareable versions (720p video, CDG, TXT) are copied for public distribution. |
| F7 | `--enable_youtube_upload` | ✅ | ✅ | **Upload to YouTube.** After encoding, upload the lossy 4K video to YouTube. Local: uses OAuth flow with client secrets. Remote: uses server-side stored credentials. |
| F8 | `--youtube_client_secrets_file` | ✅ | N/A | **YouTube OAuth credentials.** Local path to Google OAuth client secrets JSON file for YouTube API. Only needed for local mode - remote uses server-stored credentials. |
| F9 | `--youtube_description_file` | ✅ | ✅ | **YouTube video description.** Path to text file containing YouTube video description template. Supports placeholders like `{artist}`, `{title}`, `{brand_code}`. |
| F10 | `--rclone_destination` | ✅ | N/A | **Rclone sync destination.** Rclone remote path to sync public_share_dir to. Used for Google Drive public sharing. Example: `googledrive:KaraokePublic`. |
| F11 | `--dropbox_path` | N/A | 🔹 | **Dropbox folder (native API).** Remote-only: Dropbox folder path for organized output upload using native Dropbox API. Example: `/Karaoke/Tracks-Organized`. |
| F12 | `--gdrive_folder_id` | N/A | 🔹 | **Google Drive folder (native API).** Remote-only: Google Drive folder ID for public share uploads using native API. Example: `1abc123xyz`. |
| F13 | `--discord_webhook_url` | ✅ | ✅ | **Discord notification.** Webhook URL for sending completion notifications to Discord. Posts message with track info, brand code, and links. |
| F14 | `--email_template_file` | ✅ | ❌ | **Email draft template.** Path to email template file for creating Gmail drafts with track info. Supports placeholders. Uses pyperclip for manual email composition. |
| F15 | `--keep-brand-code` | ✅ | ❌ | **Preserve existing brand code.** When run from an existing track directory (with brand code in folder name), use that brand code instead of calculating a new one. Implicitly enabled with `--edit-lyrics`. |
| F16 | `-y` / `--yes` | ✅ | ✅ | **Non-interactive mode.** Auto-accept all prompts: lyrics corrections, instrumental selection, confirmations. Useful for automated/CI pipelines. Remote: auto-completes review, selects clean instrumental. |
| F17 | `--test_email_template` | ✅ | N/A | **Test email template.** Debug mode: test the email template rendering with fake data without processing any track. |

**Remote Implementation Plan:**
- **F14 `--email_template_file`**: MEDIUM PRIORITY. Two behaviors needed:
  1. **Finalisation**: Same as local - use template to create Gmail draft (requires Gmail API OAuth). User just changes recipient and sends.
  2. **API endpoint**: Expose endpoint to fetch templated message text for a job. Use case: Web frontend button to copy message for pasting into Fiverr, etc.
- **F15 `--keep-brand-code`**: HIGH PRIORITY (for `--finalise-only` workflow). When using `--finalise-only` remotely, user may be re-processing an already-published track. Must preserve existing brand code so updated files overwrite in Dropbox/GDrive rather than creating new sequence number. Implementation: Remote CLI reads brand code from local folder name, sends to backend.

### Batch 5: Flacfetch Audio Search (HIGH) ✅ COMPLETE
**Parameters:** P3 `<artist> <title>` (search mode), A1 `--auto-download`

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - PR #13 merged (v0.71.28)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Remote CLI: Detects artist+title without file, calls `/api/audio-search/search` endpoint
- Backend: New `AudioSearchService` integrates flacfetch for searching
- Backend: New job statuses `searching_audio`, `awaiting_audio_selection`, `downloading_audio`
- Backend: Returns search results for interactive selection, or auto-selects with `auto_download=true`
- Remote CLI: Displays results interactively, user selects, sends to `/api/audio-search/{job_id}/select`
- Backend: Downloads selected audio to GCS, proceeds with normal job flow
- Support `--auto-download` / `-y` for non-interactive auto-selection

**Files modified:**
- `karaoke_gen/utils/remote_cli.py` - search flow, display results, `search_audio()`, `select_audio_source()`, `handle_audio_selection()`
- `backend/api/routes/audio_search.py` - NEW: search and select endpoints
- `backend/services/audio_search_service.py` - NEW: flacfetch integration service
- `backend/models/job.py` - New statuses and fields (`audio_search_artist`, `audio_search_title`, `auto_download`)
- `backend/main.py` - Register audio_search router

**Tests added:** 20+ unit tests covering Job model fields, AudioSearchService, state transitions

**Complexity:** High (new interactive API flow, new service integration)

---

### Batch 6: Two-Phase Workflow (HIGH) ✅ COMPLETE
**Parameters:** W1 `--prep-only`, W2 `--finalise-only`, F15 `--keep-brand-code`

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2025-12-11)

**Implementation Summary:**
- **prep-only:** Added `prep_only` field to Job model. When set, backend transitions to new `PREP_COMPLETE` status after review and video rendering (with_vocals.mkv). CLI downloads all prep outputs.
- **finalise-only:** Added new endpoint `/api/jobs/create-finalise-only` for uploading prep outputs. Remote CLI detects files in prep folder, uploads them via signed URLs, and monitors finalisation.
- **keep-brand-code:** Remote CLI extracts brand code from folder name (e.g., "NOMAD-1234 - Artist - Title"), sends to backend. Video worker uses preserved brand code for distribution.

**Files modified:**
- `backend/models/job.py` - Added `PREP_COMPLETE` status, `prep_only`, `finalise_only`, `keep_brand_code` fields, updated state transitions
- `backend/api/routes/file_upload.py` - Added `prep_only`, `keep_brand_code` to job creation, new finalise-only endpoints
- `backend/workers/render_video_worker.py` - Conditional transition to PREP_COMPLETE for prep-only jobs
- `backend/workers/video_worker.py` - Use preserved brand code when set
- `backend/services/job_manager.py` - Pass new fields through job creation
- `karaoke_gen/utils/remote_cli.py` - Full implementation of prep-only, finalise-only, and keep-brand-code flows

**Tests added:**
- `backend/tests/test_models.py` - Tests for new fields and PREP_COMPLETE status
- `backend/tests/test_file_upload.py` - Tests for finalise-only models and endpoints

**Complexity:** High (significant workflow changes, new upload flow)

---

### Batch 7: Style Overrides (MEDIUM)
**Parameters:** S2 `--style_override`

**Scope:**
- Remote CLI: Parse override strings, send as array to backend
- Backend: Accept style_override array
- Backend: Merge overrides with uploaded style JSON before processing

**Files to modify:**
- `karaoke_gen/utils/remote_cli.py` - parse and send overrides
- `backend/api/routes/file_upload.py` - accept overrides
- `backend/services/style_service.py` or similar - merge logic

**Complexity:** Medium (string parsing, merge logic, asset handling)

---

### Batch 8: Video Background (MEDIUM)
**Parameters:** S3 `--background_video`, S4 `--background_video_darkness`

**Scope:**
- Remote CLI: Upload video file (larger file support needed)

**Files to modify:**
- `karaoke_gen/utils/remote_cli.py` - edit mode flow
- `backend/api/routes/` - edit endpoint or flag
- `backend/workers/orchestrator.py` - partial re-processing logic

**Complexity:** Medium-High (partial re-processing, state management)

---

### Batch 10: Email Template + Cleanup (LOW)
**Parameters:** F14 `--email_template_file`, D2 `--dry_run`, D3 `--render_bounding_boxes`
**Removal:** I3 `--no_track_subfolders`, I4 `--lossless_output_format`, I5 `--output_png`, I6 `--output_jpg`, AP6 `--instrumental_format`

**Scope:**
- **Email template:** Upload template, backend creates Gmail draft + new API endpoint to fetch formatted text

## ✅ Implementation Decisions (Answered 2024-12-10)

All questions have been answered and incorporated into the "Remote Implementation Plan" sections above. Summary of key decisions:

### Workflow Control
- **W1/W2**: YES, two-phase workflow needed. `--prep-only` downloads all prep outputs after review, `--finalise-only` uploads local folder (with any manual edits) for cloud finalisation.
- **W3-W6 Skip flags**: LOW PRIORITY - rarely used, defer until pipeline refactor provides cleaner stage-targeting.
- **W7 Edit-lyrics**: Creates NEW YouTube upload (user deletes old one manually). Backend handles duplicate title gracefully.

### Input Modes
- **P2 YouTube**: HIGH PRIORITY - needed for niche live versions only on YouTube.
- **P3 Flacfetch**: HIGH PRIORITY - MUST be interactive via API (not auto-select) for future web UI audio source picker.

### Audio Processing
- **AP1-AP3 Models**: HIGH PRIORITY - all model options must work remotely (Modal API can load any model on demand).
- **AP5 Existing Instrumental**: Still run separation (for consistent stem downloads), but use provided instrumental for final video. Validate duration match (±0.5s) at job start before proceeding.

### I/O & Audio Format Options
- **I3, I4, I5, I6, AP6**: REMOVE from local CLI entirely - unnecessary options, simplifies codebase.

### Audio Fetching
- **A1 `--auto-download`**: Backend must support BOTH interactive (default, for web UI) AND auto-select (with `-y` flag) modes.

### Style
- **S2 Style Override**: MEDIUM PRIORITY - needed for web UI style tweaks (font colors, etc.).
- **S3/S4 Background Video**: MEDIUM PRIORITY - implement, will eventually allow YouTube URL or direct upload in web UI.

### Finalisation
- **F14 Email Template**: BOTH - create Gmail draft (like local) AND expose API endpoint to fetch templated text (for Fiverr copy-paste).
- **F15 Keep-brand-code**: HIGH PRIORITY for `--finalise-only` workflow - preserves brand code so updates overwrite existing Dropbox/GDrive files.
