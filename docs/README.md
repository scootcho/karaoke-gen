# Karaoke-Gen Documentation

> **Status**: Production-ready. First full E2E flow completed 2025-12-28.

## What Works

- **Web App**: https://gen.nomadkaraoke.com
  - `/` - Landing page with pricing and beta enrollment
  - `/app` - Main app (upload audio, review lyrics, download videos)
- **Backend API**: https://api.nomadkaraoke.com - FastAPI on Cloud Run
- **CLI Tools**: `karaoke-gen` (local), `karaoke-gen-remote` (cloud)

## Current State

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Audio upload & separation | Working |
| Lyrics transcription | Working |
| Agentic AI correction | Working (Gemini 3 Flash via Vertex AI) |
| Human lyrics review | Working |
| Preview video generation | Working |
| Instrumental selection | Working |
| Multi-format encoding | Working |
| Token-based auth | Working |
| Magic link auth | Working |
| Payment flow (Stripe) | Working |
| Beta tester program | Working |
| CI/CD self-hosted runner | Working (GCP) |

## Known Issues

- CDG format generation requires additional style configuration
- Long audio files (>10 min) may timeout on some workers

## Recent Changes

- **Gemini 3 Flash Agentic Correction Fix** (2025-12-30): Fixed agentic correction hanging due to Gemini 3 requiring `global` location instead of regional endpoints, and multimodal response format handling. Added local test script for faster iteration. See [archive/2025-12-30-gemini3-agentic-correction-fix.md](archive/2025-12-30-gemini3-agentic-correction-fix.md)
- **Cold Start UX** (2025-12-30): Frontend now shows friendly "Warming up the generator..." messages when backend is slow to respond (cold start after deployment or inactivity). Progressive messages appear after 5s and 15s to reassure users during 30s+ cold starts.
- **Cloud Output Structure Fix** (2025-12-30): Fixed remote CLI (`karaoke-gen-remote`) to produce identical output as local CLI: YouTube uploads now work, Dropbox includes stems/ and lyrics/ subfolders, instrumental filenames use actual model names. See [archive/2025-12-30-cloud-output-structure-fix.md](archive/2025-12-30-cloud-output-structure-fix.md)
- **Auth Session Persistence Fix** (2025-12-30): Fixed two bugs causing 401 errors despite valid sessions: timezone-aware datetime comparisons in backend, and stale token caching in frontend. Firestore indexes now tracked in Pulumi. See [archive/2025-12-30-auth-session-persistence-fix.md](archive/2025-12-30-auth-session-persistence-fix.md)
- **E2E Test Suite Consolidated** (2025-12-29): Tests reorganized into `production/` (real API) and `regression/` (mocked API, CI-safe). See [archive/2025-12-29-e2e-test-consolidation-plan.md](archive/2025-12-29-e2e-test-consolidation-plan.md)
